# 🎯 **Execution Notes**

- All **core implemented features** function as expected  
- No **functional blockers** were found in implemented modules  
- Missing features were already captured in **defect-log.md** (e.g., reviews, payments, orders, admin console)  
- Evidence screenshots show UI working correctly for each test case

# 🏁 **Conclusion**

All implemented features passed their respective test cases.  
Non-implemented features remain logged as open defects in the Phase 2 Defect Log.
